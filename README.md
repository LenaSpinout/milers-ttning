- **PyMuPDF**: Fallback method for complex or image-based PDFs

### Date Matching Algorithm
- Extracts dates from both receipts and time reports
- Performs exact date matching first
- Falls back to Â±1 day matching for near dates
- Flags unmatched entries for manual review

### Data Export
Generated CSV files include:
- Date of parking/receipt
- Matched client name
- Business address/location
- Match confidence level
- Generation timestamp
